# ðŸŽ® Simple Pong Game with Fuzzy Logic AI

This project implements a simple **Pong game** where the **AI paddle** is controlled by a **fuzzy logic system** using `scikit-fuzzy`.

Itâ€™s a small but complete demonstration of applying fuzzy logic to a real-time simulation, combining **AI concepts** with **Python programming and visualization**.

## ðŸ§© Fuzzy Logic Concept

The AI reacts to two inputs:
- `x_diff` â€” horizontal difference between the ball and the AI paddle  
- `y_diff` â€” vertical distance between the ball and paddle  

and outputs:
- `paddle_velocity` â€” how fast (and in which direction) the AI paddle should move.
